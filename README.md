## Running the client

To run the application, use the `grunt run` command. This will open up a
server listening on `port 8000`, and will rebuild the app when you change
a source file. This runs the `website` build.


## Configuration

### Grunt

Located at: `/config/grunt`

This is where you set up the **compile-time** configuration.


### App

Located at: `/config/app`

This is where you set up the **run-time** configuration. It is injected into the `App` object as the
`config` property.


## Building the app

### Website

The default grunt task builds the website version of the client.

If you want to build it manually, run `grunt build:website`.

### Phonegap

This builds the phonegap version of the client. The reason it is a separate build
is that the phonegap calls are added in during compilation.

To build this version, run `grunt build:phonegap`.
